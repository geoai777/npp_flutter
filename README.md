# Flutter/Dart syntax hilight for Notepad++
Sometimes I need to view code and android-studio or VS code are pretty heavy solutions.
For this case I decided to make Notepad++ dart/flutter syntax hilight.

## Presently
Operators, quotes, dots and comments are hilighted.

## Todo
- Figure out how to hilights `classes` and `methods`. 
- Autocompletion.
